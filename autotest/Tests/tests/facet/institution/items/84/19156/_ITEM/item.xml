<xml><item year="1985"><description>C++ (/&#x02cc;si&#x02d0;&#x02cc;pl&#x028c;s&#x02c8;pl&#x028c;s/) is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or &quot;C with Classes&quot;. The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.[9]

C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[10] C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[10] including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search, or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).[11]

  C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017 (informally known as C++17).[12] The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11 and C++14 standards. The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization.[13] Since 2012, C++ is on a three-year release schedule,[14] with C++20 the next planned standard (and then C++23).[15] </description><category name="oo"><sub-category name="static"/></category><name>C++</name><attachment>2004065c-2bf6-4cbe-b08f-478e324cc0b1</attachment><keywords><keyword>c</keyword></keywords><keywords><keyword>multi-paradigm</keyword></keywords><keywords><keyword>iso</keyword></keywords></item></xml>
