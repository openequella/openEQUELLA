/**
 * @author larry The former oneClickSubmit (aka Quick contribute, one.click.collection) and the
 *     version selection system settings moved from the admin console and merged into a single
 *     screen in EQUELLA system settings page. Accordingly the ACLs are updated in that the
 *     oneClickSubmit is removed altogether, and the versionSelection renamed to selectionSessions.
 *     In effect, all privilege holders who formerly held versionSelection now additionally hold
 *     oneClickSubmit. Former holders of oneClickSubmit who were excluded from versionSelection are
 *     now excluded from oneClickSubmit functionality.<br>
 *     Note we are taking advantage of this class to also remove the obsolete loginNotice and
 *     freetext privileges.
