title = File Manager
autoMarkAsResource = Automatically mark root-level files to be shown in the resource summary?
webdav = Allow WebDAV file management
conflict = You have chosen to automatically mark root-level files for showing on the resource summary page, and also allowing WebDAV.\nWhile this combination of options will work, it means that root-level files will always be marked for display on the\nsummary page, even if attempting to un-mark them in the File Manager.
