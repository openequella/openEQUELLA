 * Embeds the specified Kaltura Media Entry (`entryId`) using the specified player configuration
 * (`uiconf_id`). This is achieved by requesting the `embedIframeJs` script from the Kaltura CDN
 * using details of the hosting Kaltura account.
 *
 * When that script is retrieved and embedded in the page, it is then auto executed through the
 * use of the `async` flag on the `script` tag. The execution of the script causes a player to
 * be embedded on the div identified with the `playerId` using `kWidget.embed`.
 *
 * Further resources available at:
 *
 * - Player (`kWidget`) example doco: http://player.kaltura.com/docs/kwidget
 * - Older API doco relating to `kWdiget`: http://player.kaltura.com/docs/api
 *
 * Note: This method is based on the embed code generated via the KMC share/embed functionality.
 *       Although there is the newer doco pointing to the PlayerKitJs, on attempting to use that
 *       a 404 was received. And seeing the KMC is still generating code with embedIframeJs this
 *       seems the correct way.
