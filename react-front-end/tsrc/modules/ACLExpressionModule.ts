/**
 * Prepare a simpler tree structure from `parse` for rendering in the UI.
 * This only has to do with the handling of None groupings (or syntactically, NOT operators).
 *
 * Note:
 * For a normal tree structure used to generate an expression string,
 * `NOT` is a very special Operator that in theory if an ACLExpression's operator is `NOT` it can only have one recipient or one `OR` child.
 *
 * Case 1:
 * ```

 * ```
 *
 * Case 2:
 * ```
 * NOT
 *   OR
 *     A B

 *
 * But it's a bit cumbersome for users, in order to simply the UI we have another type of ACLExpression,
 * called `compacted ACLExpression`
 * which will compact a `NOT` ACLExpression make it act like a normal ACLExpression
 * that can have multiple recipients and children.
 *
 * Implementation Details:
 * For a `NOT` ACLExpression, the function extracts all children's recipients and their children, and
 * then add all recipients to its recipients attribute and overwrite its children attribute with new children. (recursively).
 *
 * Besides, although in theory the input `NOT` ACLExpression should follow the rules mention above(only one recipient or child),
 * if the received ACLExpression breaks rules it will still compact the ACLExpression.
 * (Thus, although there is another function can be used to revert the compacted ACLExpression
 * , in this case you will get a different ACLExpression from what you received here.)
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * input:
 * ```
 * NOT
 *   A
 * ```
 *
 * output:
 * ```
 * NOT
 *   A
 * ```
 *
 * Example 2:
